			<strong>Swarashraya Gana Sabha</strong>&reg; in collaboration with <strong>Kala
				Sandesha Prathishtana</strong>&reg; presents '<strong>Geetharnava</strong>',
			an annual music festival. This festival has been crafted solely to
			promote Indian Classical Music- Vocal as one of the objectives of the
			organisation. It aims at providing an unbiased platform for <br />both
			Karnataka and Hindustani classical music. It is an attempt to portray
			and thus drive the mass towards class through Indian music. Eminent
			virtuosi are offered a stage through Geetharnava for their music
			concerts every year.
