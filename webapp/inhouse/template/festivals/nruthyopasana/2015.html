Karna choosing the point of no return to fight Pandavas, the strategies adopted by Krishna to witness the victory of the Pandavas during the great Kurukshetra war and the discrepancy hat occurred when the mark of truth, sacrifice and bravery, breathed his last are fragments of this unique interpretation by <strong>Pampa</strong>, Kannada poet of 10<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
