				The festival was formally inaugurated <strong>Dr. Vasundhara Doraswamy</strong>, 
				Millennium Artist awarded by UNO, accompanied by <strong>Dr. R.S. Nandha Kumar,</strong> 
				Vocalist, Music Composer, Mysore whose address to the students was a great 
				inspiration for all of us.The formal function also witnessed the <strong>felicitation</strong> 
				program of our Dance Guru Vid. <strong>Sri R. Kannan</strong>, Senior Dance Teacher, Mysore, 
				who has contributed enough to the Dance field by teaching Dance in a rural area like 
				T. Narasipura for more than Two decades. Talented Artists of our Trust were awarded a 
				Certificate Excellence in honour of their high academic performance, in order to support

				The commencement of this festival will be accomplished by the performance of the Vid. 
				<strong>Sri K Sandesh Bhargav</strong>, senior disciple of Karnataka Kala Tilaka Dr. Vasundhara 
				Doraswamy. The long recital holds the traditional base of <strong>Marga</strong>. The highlight of 
				this portrayal clings to the character &lsquo;<strong>Karna</strong>&rsquo; from the very famous 
				<strong>Pampa Bharatha</strong>, beautifully designed into a Padavarna. &lsquo;Bravery or the 
				sacrifice should we salute, as Karna makes his alms to Indra&rsquo; are among the first few lines. 
				Karna choosing the point of no return to fight Pandavas, the strategies adopted by Krishna to witness 
				the victory of the Pandavas during the great Kurukshetra war and the discrepancy hat occurred when 
				the mark of truth, sacrifice and bravery, breathed his last are fragments of this unique interpretation 
				by <strong>Pampa</strong>, Kannada poet of 10<sup>th</sup> Century.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sandesh has wonderfully presented the Bharathanatyam Margam performance. His soothing performance 
				with extraordinary grace on face, energetic Nrutta and charming expressions stolen the heart of 
				audience. This was the highlight of the performance by Sandesh Bhargav.
